# Project
Predicting the future performance and potential of NBA players is a challenging yet critical task for teams, scouts, and analysts. Accurate predictions can influence draft decisions, team building strategies, and player development programs. This project aims to solve the problem of identifying future NBA stars based on their individual statistics. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to provide a reliable model that can forecast a player's potential success, thus aiding in making informed decisions.

# Key aspects of the problem include:
Identifying the most important features (player statistics) that contribute to a player's future success.
Building a predictive model that can accurately classify players into potential future stars and others.
Comparing different classification algorithms to determine the most effective method for this specific task.
Methods Used
To tackle this problem, we employed two popular classification algorithms: Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifier. The process involved several steps, including data collection, preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

## Data Collection:
Gathered player statistics from a reliable dataset, including features such as games played, minutes played, field goals, three-point goals, effective field goal percentage, total rebounds, assists, blocks, and points.

## Feature Selection:
Identified and selected the most relevant features that contribute to predicting a player's future success.

## Model Training:
Decision Tree Classifier: A simple yet powerful classification algorithm that splits the data into subsets based on the most significant features, creating a tree-like model of decisions.

Random Forest Classifier: An ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes (classification) of the individual trees. This approach helps in reducing overfitting and improves accuracy.

# Results  
Used cross-validation and performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and F1-score to evaluate and compare the models.
The project compared the performance of the Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers. Here are the key findings:
## Decision Tree Classifier:
Provided a clear and interpretable model with a decent accuracy but was prone to overfitting on the training data.  
Performance metrics:  
Accuracy: 96.15%  
Precision: 61.29%  
F1-Score: 65.52%  
## Random Forest Classifier:
Outperformed the Decision Tree classifier by reducing overfitting and providing better generalization on unseen data.
Leveraged the power of ensemble learning to improve the robustness and accuracy of the predictions.  
Performance metrics:  
Accuracy: 98.08%  
Precision: 86.96%  
F1-Score: 80%  

# Conclusion:
The Random Forest Classifier demonstrated superior performance in predicting future NBA stars based on player statistics.
The model can be a valuable tool for teams and analysts in making informed decisions regarding player drafts and development.
Future work could involve exploring additional features, fine-tuning the model parameters, and testing with more recent data to further improve the accuracy and reliability of the predictions.
